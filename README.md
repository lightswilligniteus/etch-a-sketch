Etch-a-Sketch using Javascript, HTML and CSS

The etch-a-sketch follows the requirements setout by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

The current working version is the optional task which requires 10 passes over a square to turn fully black (it increases gradient by 10% on each pass).
